# ⌨️ Speed Typing Test App

An interactive Desktop Application built with Python and Tkinter that measures your typing speed (WPM) and accuracy in real-time. This project highlights the transition from CLI scripts to Event-Driven Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time WPM Calculation:** Instantly calculates your Words Per Minute as you type.
- **Accuracy Tracking:** Provides feedback on your typing precision.
- **Visual Feedback:** Uses dynamic UI updates to show progress and results.
- **Local Highscore System:** Saves your best performance in a `highscore.txt` file (managed via `.gitignore` to keep your records private).
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean layout with a "Reset / New Round" functionality.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.14
- **Library:** Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)
- **Environment:** PyCharm
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub (with custom `.gitignore` implementation)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/DenisFlorin15/Typing-Speed-Test-Python.git](https://github.com/DenisFlorin15/Typing-Speed-Test-Python.git)

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Typing-Speed-Test-Python

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- GUI Development: Designing and managing widgets (Buttons, Labels, Text entries) in Tkinter.

- Event Handling: Capturing keyboard events to trigger logic in real-time.

- Data Persistence: Reading and writing to local files for highscore tracking.

- Version Control Best Practices: Implementing a .gitignore to separate source code from local data and IDE configurations.
